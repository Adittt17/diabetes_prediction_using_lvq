# üß† Diabetes Prediction Using LVQ

This is a simple web-based application built with **Streamlit** that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on medical data inputs. The prediction is powered by the **Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)** machine learning algorithm.

## üöÄ Features

- Interactive input form for medical indicators such as glucose, BMI, and insulin levels.
- Uses a pre-trained LVQ model to classify whether a user has diabetes.
- Real-time prediction result with clear output.
- Lightweight and easy to deploy.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Model Accuracy:**  
The current LVQ model achieves an accuracy of **71%** on test data. While this shows initial promise, we plan to improve performance in future iterations through better preprocessing, feature selection, or alternative model architectures.

## üß¨ About LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization)

**Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)** is a prototype-based supervised classification algorithm. It uses a set of codebook vectors (also called weights) to represent class prototypes in the feature space. During prediction, the algorithm calculates the distance between an input and these prototypes and assigns the input to the class of the nearest prototype.

**Why LVQ?**
- Simple and fast for real-time prediction.
- Effective for low-dimensional data like structured medical records.
- Interpretable decision-making process based on distances.

## üì¶ Installation
